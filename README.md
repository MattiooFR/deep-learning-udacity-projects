# Projects done during my Udacity Deep Learning Nano Degree

[My certificate](https://confirm.udacity.com/7MG7UEFA)

___

## [Bike Sharing Prediction](1-bike-rental-prediction/)

First project where I used a Neural Network to train on sharing bikes data and predicting future data.
___

## [Dog Classification](2-dog-classification/)

In this project I used a pretrained CNN where I changed the classifier to have 133 dogs breed output instead of the 1024 categories of the ImageNet dataset. Doing so I achieved 85% accuracy.

___

## [TV Script Generation](3-tv-script-generation/)

The goal of this project is to generate TV script content with an Recurrent Neural Network that we trained on TV scripts dataset before.

___

## [Face Generation](4-project-face-generation/)

In this project, we used Generative Adversarial Network to train on the CelebA dataset (a dataset of celebrities faces) so it can learn and generate human faces.

___

## [AWS SageMake Sentiment Analysis Deployment](5-aws-sagemaker-deployment/)

This last project we had to apply all the knowledge about using Amazon SageMaker service.
We first had to download and process the data. For that we used a data set of movie reviews.

___

## The Exercises folder

The [exercises folders](exercises) contain all the practicing exercises we had to do during the whole course.
