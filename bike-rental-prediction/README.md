# Bike Saring Prediction

First deep learning project of my Udacity Nanodegree program.

This is a 13 hidden node that predict the rate of usage for bike sharing with a wide range of previous data input like bike sharing usage, temperature, weather, ...

Learning rate is 0.7 with 7000 iterations. The model obtain 6% mistake on the training set, and 15% mistake on untrained data.
