# Bike Sharing Prediction

This is a **13 hidden node** that predict the rate of usage for bike sharing with a wide range of previous data input like bike sharing usage, temperature, weather, ...

**Learning rate** is 0.7 with 7000 iterations. The model obtain 6% mistake on the training set, and 15% mistake on untrained data.

The final delta of mistakes between training set and untrained data is because the used untrained data is during the month of december, and the model wasnt trained with enough christmas data to be efficient predicting data during that period.

The model obtain 6% mistake on the training set, and 15% mistake on untrained data.
